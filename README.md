## Problem

This project responds to the need to monitor your blockchain.
Nowadays, getting feedback about a certain transaction outside your wallet application doesn't exit.
## Solution

PoCorn offers you the possibility to notify the user by discord about an action on the blockchain.
There is also a version for Berty, but it's still in progress.

For this project, we use ReactJS for the Front using Chakra UI and for the Back a discord bot using PyBot and an API using fastAPI.
The biggest technical challenge was to decentralize Aleph VM and link different services in it.
## Installation

There is no installation this is in [production](http://51.68.94.127:3000)


### Quickstart

You need to invite our discord bot to your server with this [link](https://discord.com/api/oauth2/authorize?client_id=969945066305122354&permissions=8&scope=bot). The configuration will be automatically done.
### Usage

After inviting the bot, go to this [Website](http://51.68.94.127:3000/) and generate the configuration you want for your bot.

## Side-Quests

- Aleph VM - We tried to use it to run the application and discord bot on it but this is not working well, even Aleph Developper doesn't know why it doesn't work.

- Starton Notify - It's used to be notified with new information on the blockchain to our discord bot

## Our Pocorn team

During this hackathon we learned how to use the Starton API.
Also we learned more about channels bot and we plan for the future to implement this in other apps like Berty.
